PHP-File-Crawler
================

PHP based file crawler initially for archiving data off old hard drives for a client


Goals

- file crawler with filtering by directory and filename (regex & simple list)
- data handler to handle the full file names (iterable with helpers/filters)
- aggregator to give stats and breakdowns (# files, folders, per extension, etc)

To Do
-----

- get the framework finished and in place

Progress Notes
--------------

Simple observer pattern in place with basic data handler (simple array for now)
